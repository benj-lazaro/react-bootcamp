Files And Folder Overview
-------------------------
- Brief overview of the project files generated by Vite when creating a React app


- The file "index.html"
    - Serves as the main HTML template 
        - Also referred as the "root HTML" of a React application
        - It is just a normal HTML document

    - It contains an
        - HTML element <div>
            - With an HTML attribute "id", assigned the value of "root"

        - HTML element <script>
            - With an HTML attribute "src", assigned the value of "src/main.jsx"         


- The file "src/main.jsx"
    - Serves as the main React file
        - Contains the React code base & components

    - This file can be renamed into something else
        - NOTE: Update the value of HTML element <script> in the file "index.html"

    - The folder "src"
        - Contains ALL files containing React code


- The file "vite.config.js"
    - Serves as the pre-defined Vite configuration file
        - Use to cutomize build settings, plugins & path
        - MOST of the time, thsi file will NOT be touched


- The file ".gitignore" file
    - Contains the list of files that will be IGNORED by GitHub


- THe folder "public"
    - Contains ALL static assets (e.g. images)
    - The files are often accessed from w/in the file "index.html"


- Exercise
    - Refactor the generated React project that is current running (e.g. "npm run dev")
        - Strip off unncessary files & folders
        - Make it into a simple and cleaner project

    - Delete the following files from their corresponding folders
        - src/App.css
        - src/App.jsx
        - src/index.css
        - assets/react.svg

        - NOTE: Leaving only the file "main.jsx" behind

    - Open the file "main.jsx"
        - Remove the corresponding import statements

            import './index.css'
            import App from './App.jsx'

    - Remove the component "<App />"
        - Located in-between the pair of "<StrictMode>" tags
        
    - Replace the component "<App />"with the string "Hello"

    - Save the changes
        - The React app automatically reloads
        - Renders the string "Hello" on the browser

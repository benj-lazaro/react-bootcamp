Files And Folder Overview
-------------------------
- A brief overview of the generated project files by Vite
    - When a React project is created


- The file "index.html"
    - The main HTML template or "root HTML" of a React application
        - Just a normal HTML document

    - Contains a HTML element <div>
        - With an HTML attribute "id" with the value of "root"

    - Contains a HTML element <script>
        - With the HTML attribute "src" with the value of "src/main.jsx"
        
        - NOTE: Update this whenver "main.jsx" is renamed


- The file "src/main.jsx" file
    - This is the main React file
        - Contains React components

    - NOTE: This file can be renamed to something else
        - Just remember to update the value of HTML element <script> in "index.html"

    - The folder "src" contains all files containing React code 


- The file "vite.config.js"
    - A pre-defined Vite configuration file
        - To customize build settings, plugins & path
        - NOTE: Most of the time, will NOT work on this file


- The file ".gitignore" file
    - Defines files to be IGNORED by GitHub


- THe folder "public"
    - Contains all static assets (e.g. images)
    - Often accessed from within the file "index.html"


- Refactor the React project
    - To start with a simple (and cleaner) project

    - Delete the files
        - src/App.css
        - src/App.jsx
        - src/index.css
        - assets/react.svg

    - Open the file "main.jsx"
    
    - Remove the following import statements

        import './index.css'
        import App from './App.jsx'

    - Remove the component "<App />"
        - Located within the pair of "<StrictMode>"
        - Replace with the text "Hello"

    - Save the changes
        - React app reloads
        - Renders the text "Hello" on the browser

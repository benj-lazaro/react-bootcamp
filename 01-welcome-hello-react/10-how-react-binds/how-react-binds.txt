How React Binds
---------------
- A walkthrough on how a React app works
    - On the starter project's file "src/main.jsx" 
    

- The function "createRoot()"
    - Imported from "react-dom/client"
        - NOTE: React-DOM is part of React that renders content in the browser

    - The document Method ".getElementById()" is called w/in the function's parameter list
        - To select an HTML element w/in "index.html"

            <div id="root"></div>

    - Chain calls another docuement Method ".render()"
        - Accepts content (e.g. HTML element & data) as argument value 

        - The content will be rendered w/in the selected HTML element 

        - NOTE: Any previous content w/in the selected HTML will be overwritten

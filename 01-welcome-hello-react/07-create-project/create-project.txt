Create Project
--------------
- To create a React project using Vite
    - Reference (https://vite.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project)


- Open project folder in VS Code
    - Launch an Integrated Terminal window
    - NOTE: On Windows, opens a PowerShell (PS) prompt
    

- Excute the following command using npm (Node Package Manager) of Node.JS
    
    npm create vite@latest

    - NOTE: On Windows, might encounter the following warning

        "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled..."

    - To address this concern
        - Execute the PowerShell command

            Set-ExecutionPolicy RemotedSigned -Scope CurrentUser

        - Then restart the VS Code editor

        - Re-open the project folder & launch an Integrated Terminal window

        - Repeat the command 

            npm create vite@latest


- The npm (Node Package Manager) ask for confirmation
    - To install the package "create-vite"
    - Press "y" to proceed


- Next, it asks for the project's name
    - Provide the name of the project
    - Then press ENTER to proceed


- Next, asks which JavaScript framework to install
    - Using the arrow keys
    - Select "React"
    - Then press ENTER to proceed


- Next, asks for a (JavaScript) variant to install
    - Using the arrow keys
    - Select "JavaScript"
    - Then press ENTER to proceed


- Next, asks if the project will use rolldown-vite (Experimental)
    - Using the arrow keys
    - Select "No" (default)
    - Then press ENTER to proceed


- Next, asks to install with "npm" and to immediately start
    - Using the arrow keys
    - Select "No" (default)
    - Then press ENTER to proceed


- The npm downloads & then installs the dependencies
    - Then Vite generates the corresponding React project files


- The npm automatically runs & locally hosts the React project
    - Generates a URL displayed in the "Local" field
    - Hold down "CTRL" and then click the generated URL
    - Launches the default browser & loads the started React project


- To terminate a running React project
    - Press "CTRL+C"


- NOTE: This demonstrates the creation of a basic template for
    - A React project using "plain vanilla" JavaScript


- To manually restart the React project
    - Launch the Integrated Terminal within the project folder

    - Execute the commands

        npm install && npm audit fix

        npm run dev


- The generated file "package.json" contains
    - Dependencies & respective version number required by the React project


- The generated folder "node_modules"
    - Contains the installed dependencies listed in the file "package.json"

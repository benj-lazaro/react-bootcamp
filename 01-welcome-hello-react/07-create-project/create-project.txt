            - Re-open the project folder and launch the integrated terminal window

        - Execute the npm command

            npm create vite@latest

        cd <project_folder>/

        npm run dev


- The generated file "package.json" 
    - Lists the dependencies (& repective versions) needed by the React project to run


- The generated folder "node_modules"
    - Contains the downloaded & installed dependencies listed in the file "package.json"

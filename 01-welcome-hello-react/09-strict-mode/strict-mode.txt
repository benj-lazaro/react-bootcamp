Strict Mode
-----------
- "StrictMode" is a helper Method that
    - Double-checks your code during development

    - Warns about unsafe code and spot side-effects
        - e.g. Outdated lifecycle methods

    - Help prepare code for future versions of React

    - Does NOT CHANGE (or influence) the rendered output
        - Seen by users on the browser


- Within a React application (e.g. "src/main.jsx")
    - It is imported using the statement

        import { StrictMode } from "react";

    - W/in the createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))render()
        - Calls the Component <StrictMode> similar to that of a HTML element
        - With the corresponding content placed in-between

        <StrictMode>
            ...
        </StrictMode>


- "StrictMode" can be removed from a React application
    - Remove the corresponding "import" statement

    - Replace the Component <StrictMode> w/ an HTML element <div>
